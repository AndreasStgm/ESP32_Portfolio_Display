# ESP32 Portfolio Display

This project is created to have a vintage terminal aesthetic to display my portfolio using an ESP32-S3.
For now it works with buttons, but the intention is to make it work with the touch screen.

## Navigation

At first you'll get a menu with the various sub-topics that are within the portfolio.

- International Project
- Honours Program
- Bluetooth Media Controller
- Personal Reflection
- Future Goals

This looks like this:

```

|     Future Goals                 |

```

Then you can press the confirm button to go to a specific section.
These will contain a more detailed explanation of the topic.

This looks like this:
